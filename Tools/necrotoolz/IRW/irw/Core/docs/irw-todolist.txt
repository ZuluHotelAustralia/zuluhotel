=================================================================

--/[10/03/2005]/--
version 1.4 released

observations:
- released before plugin devs kill me :P
- couldnt get the time to add the core plugins that plugin devs wrote... crap
  those plugins rule

updates:
- added Ziemniaq's journal updates, new functions:
  JournalGetLast JournalDump SetJournalLine
- notoriety is now added to the flags (from packet 0x78)

info plugin fixes:
- fixed how it gets hidden and war status for the new flag system

--/[10/03/2005]/--
updates:

- new flag: poisoned
- war, hidden, poisoned and other flags are now accessed through the obj, not
  the character. this way an obj or character can have up to 32 different flags
  male and female will now be defined in the flags as well
  new defines: GETOBJFLAG SETOBJFLAG CLEAROBJFLAG


--/[9/03/2005]/--
observations:
- yeah uni is taking shit loads of my time, but its fun ;)

fixes:
- war and hidden status were being saved in memory with their flags 0x40 and
  0x80 instead of setting them as bools (1 or 0). now they will be 1 or 0

updates:
- the logs will now be saved to IRWMAIN\Logs\...
  ... being the log name


--/[6/03/2005]/--
fixes:
- completly updated ArgToInt, UOWorld.c, UOTarget.c and UONetwork.c to use
  the alias system
- ,set now sets aliases and the prefix (a part of the alias system update)
- ListPlugins (I cant believe I didnt add this to the devlog before) now
  returns a plugin table in the same way that ListCommands and ListAliases do
  it was returning a pointer to pointers with strings before
- the Z value (used a lot in uotarget) is now completly treated as an int
  but the world structure for items still treats it as a char (no need to change atm)

updates:
- added ,listplugins and ,listaliases
  they show how to use the plugin and aliases list

LSU plugin added: (by Lem)
Lemrey's Suppah Utilies
- ,playwav and ,memshrink... ,memshrink rules so bad :P

--/[5/03/2005]/--
fixes:
- I completly rebuilt how commands work. now there is no limit of commands
  the list is dynamic
- journal code now adds a prefix (name or something like "You see") to messages
- added a handler for 0xc1 packet (cliloc messages) for the journal system
  todo: figure out an use for it :P

updates:
- added an alias system. so players can do stuff like ,setalias mymoney lasttarget
  or ,setalias mymoneygraph 3414
  functions: AddAlias, RemoveAlias, SetAlias and GetAlias
  current aliases are: on off self backpack lasttarget lasttilex/y/z catchbag
  lastcontainer dropbadpackets
- added two functions that return DIRECT access to the command and alias list
  ListCommands and ListAliases. be VERY careful when using them. they are read only!

  tomorrow I'll update IRW so all the global vars (lasttarget, catchbag.. etc)
  use the alias system instead of acting like vars
  

--/[4/03/2005]/--
fixes:
- changed the speech types of the journal code to match the ones of UO
  removed SPEECH_IRW
- since IRW steals the focus of the client's window when IRW's GUI is created
  IRW will now set the focus on the client with SetForegroundWindow


--/[2/03/2005]/--
fixes:
- IRW had a tendency of accumulating packets by priorizing recv's (the api) buffer
  instead of IRW's buffer (RecvFull)
  I kinda rebuild hook_select and how the 400c fix works
  now there is no BOOL to indicate when to fake select. now select does so by
  checking data in recvfull
  now all data in recvfull will be sent to client before checking for data in recv
  ps: this is the thing that caused the lag

updates:
- journal handling (by Ziemniaq)
- added handling for 0x1c packet, for journal
- UnloadPlugin function in plugins is now called before IRW's window is
  destroyed

Dress plugin:
- added ,disarm ,undress ,mount ,unmount


--/[1/03/2005]/--
Observations:
- why do I always forget that february skips a few days? :P
- Xan confirmed me that recv() has a bug thats causing lag in irw
  he's looking into it

fixes:
- OpenContainer now sets an object as a container (by Xan)
- multi targetting wasnt being checked. packet 0x99 is now hooked (by Xan)
- packet builder now checks if the partial buffer is empty
- packet builder now terminates the client on unknown packets
- removed "GOD:" from 0x12 packet name
- changed all strings in apis to const char*
  command strings (ArgToInt, HandleCommand and AddCommand) will still
  be char* though


updates:
- catchbag is now correctly emulated as in Yoko's injection
  added IRWClient_DropItem (by Xan)
- OpenContainer now sets the container as LastOpenContainer (by ziemniaq)

--/[27/02/2005]/--
version 1.3 released

updates:
- if connect() fails it will print the error to the log
- the GUI main window will from now on have the title "IRW" instead of "Injection"
  all kids must breal free one day... heh
- all plugins have been recompiled. this irw.h and irw.lib in their folders
  are updated. I'll try to do this every IRW update
- this time I changed the irw version string :P

Macro plugin:
- disarm on cast is now enabled. command ,disarmoncast
- added a devcpp project

Smoothwalk plugin (by illusion - nigga):
- the very first IRW plugin was added, now that we have a movement handler
- commands are: ,smoothwalk and ,resync


--/[26/02/2005]/--
fixes:
- fixed assignment of Direction and Z in UpdateCreature. was off by one byte (by Xan)

updates:
- added player movement handling (by Xan)
- added GetDistance to UOWorld.c. now the distance between two points can be calculated
- added PlayerIdx. makes things faster, used it in Xan's player movement code
- the "[IRW]" affix is now defined by ClientPrint, ClientPrintWarning and
  ClientPrintColor.
  ClientPrintRaw determines the affix by the Tag parameter. using up to a
  maximum of 30 bytes. the Tag parameter is set by the caller and if NULL the
  message will have no affix.
- bad packet (size != pkt len) occurances will now be warned with ClientPrint

Macro plugin:
- simulates uo macros
- commands: ,cast ,useskill ,opendoor and ,action
  cast has a full spell list (up to paladins) thanks to Xan
  useskill has a full skill list thanks to the RunUO core hehe
  action can bow and salute
  opendoor might not work on some emus, but its the way the uo client does it

  spells and skills dont need to be full in order for the command to work.
  so instead of ,cast 'Magic Arrow' the user can simply do ,cast ma
  or ,useskill ItemId can be ,useskill it
  theres no difference between lower and upper case too.


--/[25/02/2005]/--
fixes:
- errr.. 1.2 was defined as 1.1 in irw.h lol
  fixed that. from now on I'll try to constantly update it
- FindItemInContainer could/would/shouldnt return an invalid serial even
  though the object was found. now it returns the correct serial (by botserver)

about plugin:
- displays the version of irw that it was compiled with and the current core
  also displays the count of total objects in the world, used ones and how
  many are mobiles/characters.
  the count will only be updated when the window is "switched to". avoids lag

info plugin:
- now displays life changes and ignores server update bursts
- fixed several possible crashes where the character pointer would be freed if
  the object was not found by GetObjectInfo

--/[24/02/2005]/--
version 1.2 released

fixes:
- the fix for POL's no floor problem when encryption is 2.0.0 was a problem itself
  in runuo.. that fucking emu stalks me.
  anyway, now the generalinfo handler checks if the lastbyte of the packet is 01
  if it is, its changed to 0. this way the 02 flag (switch map) is safe
- changed the "Could not detect the client's encryption. Check..." line to
  "Could not detect the client's game encryption"
- changed the spoiled "can't cancel a target reply if not waiting for one... can I!?"
  reply in _canceltarget to "Not waiting for a target reply. Can't cancel."
- when connect uses port 28888 its a connection to the tranlation server.
  irw was redirecting that, causing transerv to wait for a connection on a loop
  ,or so I guess...
  anyway, that caused the transerv to lag the entire system. now when connect 
  is on port 28888 it will simply be ignored, withouth being redirected

updates:
- hook_connect now displays where UO is connecting to. format: IP:port
- irw now displays it the version when initializing the log

launcher fixes (by illusion - nigga):
- updates button is now disabled
- fixed the taborder in dialogs

--/[23/02/2005]/--
version 1.1 released

fixes:
- in the "_Set" function, dropbadpackets is now listed
- the gameseed is being written inverted in the login packet (lil -> big endian)
  that was cause I was using PackUInt32 instead of memcpy to write it :P
- connect redirection was being logged as signed
  instead of "redirecting to IP: 195.36.6.33" people were getting -61.36.6.33 
  defined the IP chars as unsigned char

updates:
- dropbadpackets is on by default
- ClientPrintRaw is now exported


--/[22/02/2005]/--
uoencryption:
- the UOEncryption is now a separate project from IRW, added UO's pwd
  encryption to it

launcher fixes:
- fixed a nasty memory leak in the profile dialog related to the cryptlist

irw updates:
- added IP and port redirection, they work only for the loginserver, the
  client will still be relayed by the loginserver to a gameserver, but that
  can be changed in the future
- gonna release IRW in a few minutes :)

--/[21/02/2005]/--
observations:
- yet another dry period for IRW ;)
- uni fucking rules
- runuo and razor... oh well...

fixeS:
- fixed the nasty bug in the info plugin, IRW is soon to be released

--/[12/02/2005]/--

fixes:
- fixed the memory leaks in the world handler, ALLOCCHAR all over the place
  I forgot to remove them since I changed how GetObjectInfo works hehe


--/[11/02/2005]/--
Observations:
- at every change of socket (game or login) the client initializes the crypt
  stuff with the game seed
- this issue happens only when there's more than one server in the server list:
  if you try to connect with client 2.0.3 and at the servers screen you just
  press enter instead of choosing which server you want, the client will not
  initialize the twofish encryption. thus the tables created will be the ones
  of LoginSeed instead of GameSeed. the client also wont send the gameseed,
  just the login2 packet (0x91).

  The client will still build the login2 packet with the gameseed provided by
  the server in the relay packet (0x8c) but it will encrypt with the loginseed.

  when you just press enter instead of choosing the server, the client chooses
  the last server in the list

  I wasnt going to fix this, but it happens in all clients that use 2Fish
  so I tried and did the changes to fix it, small changes since IRW's code is
  really maleable :)
  turns out it works only in client 2.0.3
  the clients are more fucked up than I thought. the client will encrypt 64 random
  bytes before encrypting the 65 bytes of login2.
  the encryption function does something like TFCrypt(Login2 - 0x40, 0x4E + 0x40)
  sooooooo... this is one of osi's error that I cant fix. a good hack for this
  is to just remove the encryption on the client's asm

  after I set POL to one server instead of two, I was not able to reproduce
  this bug... shice
  and I tried a lot of stuff to reproduce it so... I think its gone for good
  I bet it was the damaged user datafiles of uo


updates:
- the log will now be built in IRW's folder with the following name:
  IRW(DD-MM-YYYY)(HH-MI-SS).txt
  DD - day   MM - month   YYYY - year
  HH - hour  MI - minute  SS - second
- added checks to the api hooks. now if one of the apis is not hooked
  a messagebox (mbout) is displayed and IRW ends UO's process
- when UO's window is initialized, the focus will be set on it

Launcher fixes:
- now UO will be correctly started even though the executable is not at
  UO's main folder. this was cause CreateProcess was using the commandline
  instead of application name parameter. must be a weird windows bug


--/[09/02/2005]/--
fixes:
- small changes to seed handling in HandleSocket
  it will now display which seed is received. login or game
  this allows the seed to be changed
- Font = atoi(Arg[3]); instead of Color =... in ,say (Illusion)


--/[08/02/2005]/--
Observations:
- carnival sux

fixes:
- GetObjectInfo now allocates the character structure. the caller is responsable for always calling FREECHAR after GetObjectInfo
- optimized the checking of objidx in all the serial/idx related functions in UOWorld
- RemoveObject double checked if .Character was null or not. now it checks only once (its builtin FREECHAR)
- removed all cast warnings (which were in ImportHook :P) by using UINT_PTR stuff
- read handlers had their pointer set as of (IRWPacketHandler), changed it to (IRWPacketReader)

Launcher fixes:
- removed all the C4267 warnings from vs.net by setting all strlen to something like (unsigned int)(strlen(...) & 0xFFFFFFFF)
  shice 64bit support...
- removed *all* cast warnings by using UINT_PTR stuff
- the IRWPath\\Profiles directory will now be created if it does not exist
  and you are creating a new profile
- last time I changed the launcher I removed the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag from
  CreateProcess and I added a Sleep(5000).
  removed the sleep, added the flag

--/[07/02/2005]/--
Observations:
- wow first update in 2 weeks more or less :o
- when there is a "noid" item in UO's registry, the client starts to use the
  IGR login system, 0xCF packet

fixes:
- the 0xCF packet is now named "IGR Account login request" instead of "Account Login"
- the 0x91 packet is now named "Login to game server request"
- changed the StartLoginCrypt function to check for the 0xCF packet.
  it also builds a 0x80 or a 0xCF packet, following the UOEncryption library fix.
  last bytes of both packets are ignored

Launcher fixes:
- after *MUCH* hardwork, the launcher can inject dlls that are located
  anywhere in the system and it can inject multiple dlls. it can also call
  multiple functions from DLLs. this avoids the need of having IRW's dlls
  in the client's folder. now the client is launched with the base folder
  being the client's base folder. RTD: should the base folder be set to UO's base folder?
  I had to rewrite the entire LoadLibraryOnProcess function. it works like
  a charm now.
  *BUT* for some reason the function is miscompiled on both VS.net 2k3 and devcpp
  I should send this code for analysis... this is fucking weird.
  my bet is that the whole (char**) thing fucks up the compiling


UOEncryption library fix:
- the get keys module has been changed, now it uses only 61 bytes to find the keys
  the caller only needs to build the following data:
  BYTE[1] cmd, BYTE[30] login, BYTE[30] pwd
  this way the last byte of the 0x80 packet (NextLoginKey value in uo.cfg) is
  ignored.
  the last bytes of the 0xCF packet are also ignored.
  61 bytes is more than enough to find the login keys.

UOKeys.cfg update:
- added loginkeys of 408, 407 and 406 clients.
  is there a 405? :P

--/[23/01/2005]/--
Observation:
- not much to say today... Got in Computer Engineering in PUC-PR... my friends
  shaved my head... I'm bald atm :P

fixes:
- since the world update handlers and the packet read handlers are added
  on a "stream"-way, HandleWorld and HandlePacket will now break the loop
  when the end of the list is found OR there's nothing left (pointer == 0)


--/[19/01/2005]/--
fixes:
- the generalinfo hook had a wrong comment
  changed the "bf 00 06 00 08 01" to "bf 06 00 00 08 01"
- fixed the window handle check in the info plugin
- AddWorldCallBack changed to AddWorldCallback (find the error lol)

plugins
Info Plugin:
- player list now works, npcs such as animals and monsters go to it as well
  maybe I should remove that...
  anyway... yeah thats it... didn't get to code much today
  went to sleep 4am, woke up at 6am for uni... signed up btw! I'm an official
  Computer Engineer student now... take that... whoever you are! :P
  so damn sleepy... lol
  gotta hang on... one more hour and my day is over... one more hour...

--/[18/01/2005]/--
Observation:
"The Village" just kicks ass... you gotta watch it man

fixes:
- changed the buffer sizes for MAX_COMMANDS, its now defined as 200

updates:
- added AddWorldCallback, HandleWorld functions
  almost all world update hooks have a call to handleworld
- added the LastAttack property to characters now. This is the serial of the last
  character that the character attacked
- added the DropItemAtLocation and the MoveToLocation functions

plugins:
Info Plugin:
- added the OnPlayerUpdate function, its blank atm
- added the target textbox to the layer info


--/[17/01/2005]/--
fixes:
- IRw handlers (internalhandlers) are now processed before readonly handlers
  for safety reasons and cause readonly handlers are used by plugins which
  might expect IRW to already know the contents of that packet
- set all the global (private... I dont like extern vars) to "static"
  in the core and in the info plugin
  TODO: do the same in all plugins

updateS:
- all the world functions that take Idx as input now have a invalid idx check
  if the index doesn't exist then INVALID_IDX is returned
- added the GetUOScreenData function

plugins:
Info Plugin:
- added the list handling functions


--/[14/01/2005]/--
Observation:
"The Grudge" sux bad, worst movie since Scream 3 ;)

fixes:
- fixed the format of the packetID defines in UOProtocol.h
  from tabs (0x09) its now using spaces (0x20)
  I made a small program (docs/Deformater.c) to do the job for me
- added packet 0xDC to packet names, packet sizes and packet id defines
- added a "small" comment with all 0xBF subcmds based on RunUO and Krrios



--/[11/01/2005]/--
launcher fixes:
- Fixed a bug in CheckCurSel, added a "Item == -1" to the if

launcher updates:
- Added a GetCurrentInstance to Main.c (so the other modules could use it)
- Added irw's icon to the launcher (main window, change path window and edit window)
- Added an update and a cancel button to the change path window
- Changed change path's window from an edit box to a text box (same thing actually
  but now users can only read from it)
- Changed the STATIC_INFO to TEXT_INFO, gotta fix the text len of it :)



--/[08/01/2005]/--
updates:
- Added comments to the entire HandleCommand function

plugins:
- Info Plugin:
  Changed the commands a bit. Now its as it should be.
  Added the Players dialog.
  Discarded the player picture idea for the layers.
  Changed the 25 layer buttons to 25 layer checkboxes :P
  more than one checkbox can be selected and the look is cleanear.
  Started to write the players list. I expect to end it by tomorrow.
  Have to add updating (easy) and menu (2x eep)
  possible addons could be: moving attackers to the beginning of the list

--/[04/01/2005]/--
RESEARCH INFO:
- ok, I made the client research to find out what goes on with targetting
  type == TARGET_OBJECT == 0:
  the client will only take as input an object or cancel. the return in the packet
  will be the obj's serial and INVALID_XY in X, Y and Z

  type == TARGET_TILE == 1:
  the client will take as input both an object and a tile. if the input is an
  object the client returns the obj's serial and INVALID_XY in X, Y and Z
  if the input is a tile THE CLIENT WILL RETURN VALID COORDINATES AND INVALID_SERIAL!!!!
  
fixes:
- EXPORTS (.def and irw.h) has the formatting fixed. moved targetting to it's
  own section now
  added Targetting to it's own "export section" same thing to world stuff
  left a space at ordinal 350 for player stuff (like xyz)
- changed FindItemsInContainer, FindObjectsAtLocation and GetItemInLayer
  to return INVALID_SERIAL if no item was found
- removed the ClientAttach function, no more attachments to the past :)
- fixed the XYZ of the parameters of TargetReplyObj
- WaitTarget now expects the parameter Type (as in, tiles are now supported)
- changed function WaitTargetGround to WaitTargetTile (operational)
  peeps who want to target stuff from ground will have to use FindObjectAtLocation
  and then WaitTarget
  waittargetgraphic uses the items in backpack
- the entire wait target and targetting systems have been changed to use
  the graphic as well (remember: the objective of IRw is to mimic the client as much as possible)
  this allows waittargettile to target static items such as trees
  almost all targetting have now a new parameter: Graphic


updates:
- HookImportedFunction now takes the ImageBase. Callers must declare
  for the base image address I made a define to be used as the parameter:
  BASE_IMGADDR
- WaitReply now works for IRW as well (working on RequestTarget for IRW and
  IRWServer_Target for Server)
- added function: ExpectTarget
  returns a boolean value if a target reply is expected
  WaitTarget sets IRW to autoreply the next target request from both IRW and server


--/[03/01/2005]/--
Happy new year everyone!!
parties are over, so I got back to irw heh. I used last saturday to write
the new version of UOCH though... turned out to be great

anyway, the updates!

fixes:
- packetreaders now return void
- added decrypt from server (I forgot about it)

updates:
- FindItemAtLocation and FindItemInContainer altered for efficiency
  now they return ONLY by graphic, by color or by graphic AND color
  otherwise its OBJECT_NOTFOUND
  no more "return by graphic if by color not found" bullshit
- targetting now has it's own module, all targetting stuff was moved from
  UOWorld.c and .h to UOTarget.c and .h
  variables names are now especific (IRWRequestedTarget, ServerRequestedTarget ...)
  removed ExpectTargetReply, IRWRequestedTarget or ServerRequestedTarget are used instead
- WaitTarget is now added, added the functions:
  waittarget, waittargetgraphic, waittargetground (gotta wait for player xyz)
  cancelwaittarget
- fixed the formatting of most modules to look more presentable
- new control words: on, off
- ,set dropbadpackets on/off/1/0
  drop packets with size different from GetMessageLength
- lasttarget and lasttilexyz now cannot be set as INVALID by the target handler
- translated this todo/devlog list to complete english


--/[17/12/2004]/--
updates:
- TargetRequest now imitates the client by sending X and Y == 0xFFFF when
  cancelling
- Added the functions:
  PickupItem DropItem DropItemInContainer MoveToContainer EquipItem
  UnequipItem UseObject ClickObject TargetRequest TargetReplyObj
  TargetReplyTile CancelTargetRequest


--/[15/12/2004]/--

  UseObject, SetLastTarget, Get/SetLastAttack, Get/SetLastObject
  GetLastTileX/Y/Z, SetLastTile
- RequestTarget modified to support tiles
- control words created
- removed the function IsWorldActive, GetPlayerSerial should be used to check
  if the world is created or not
- EXPORTS (.def) reformulated to give a 50 ordinals spacing between groups
- control words can now be set with the ,set command
- added the control words
  self backpack lasttarget lastattack lastobject catchbag
