- mamaich
- fixed UOTD support

===================================================================
v 0.3.30.3

- chiphead
- client 3.0.6e sends a new extended command 0x0f(15), we just eat 
  this command so the server dont complain.
- added support for 3.0.6g patch 99 T2A client
- Dasc:
- added a pause after dress/undress command. New syntax is:
  dress identifier [pause in milisecs]
- mamaich:

===================================================================
v 0.3.30.1

- chiphead:
- added pause to start of watchdog so it doesn't kick off while 
  waiting to connect on slow connections

===================================================================
v 0.3.30

- mamaich:
- again, bugfixes in script.dll
- fixed (?) a bug when too many injection windows popped up at start
- added command ",usefromground type [color]". It will look for objects
  in 3 squares near you and will attempt to double click them.
  If it writes that no objects found - try to use ".resync" on sphere.
- added ",waittargetground type [color]". The same idea.
- added command UO.CountGround(type[,color]) to scripts to count items 
  in 3 squares around you laying on ground. Use UO.Say(".resync") to
  force sphere server to send information about items on ground.
  The *ground commands were not tested on servers other than sphere.
- now injection writes crash information to the log file and tries
  to continue client execution. It also records client state on hang
- fixed a bug introduced in previous version. Client crashed when
  encryption was turned off.
- fixed the main client crash reason introduced after adding script.dll
- UO.Say(...) still don't work on 9x

===================================================================

- added generic gump control (unfinished)

- mamaich changes
- bugfixes
- some minor changes in script.dll
- all Injection commands can now be accessible thru UO.Command(args)
  from scripts where Command is the Injection command. The old way

  the hook.  Should not to use the ,fixhotkeys command any more.

  of objects of given type in your backpack. Or:
   -1 if name given is not a valid object type name
   -2 if 0x???? graphic index is invalid
   -3 when not loged in
   -4 if color 0x???? is invalid
- UO.LClick, UO.Say & other "Client" commands are now working under 
  Win9x

Known Issues:

  Please be patient.

===================================================================
v 0.3.27

- ported to VC6.  See compile.txt for details.
- mamaich submited these changes!  Thanks!
- fixed a bug when Ilaunch sometimes waited indefinitely for 
  client.exe to start
- fixed display problem in client >3.0.4 (showing only "U" or 
  garbage in caption). Added a checkbox "Fix UO caption displaying 
  only first letter" to Display tab. It does nothing on clients 
  <3.0.4p
- fixed the targeting crash
- fixed major memory leaks (BoundsChecker - rulez :)
- fixed crash on exit when invalid password/encryption mode 
  specified
- fixed crash on exit and huge number of minor bugs
- added a scripting support. It resides in script.dll
- fixed "Already selling" message if trying to sell things the 
  vendor is not interested in
- removed "please cancel the current operation..." message. It 
  prevents buy/sell from working when lags

Known bugs:
- script commands interacting with UO window (ex: UO.LClick) don't 
  work on Win9x

===================================================================
v 0.3.26

- changed poison command to use the object type "poison". Define a 
  new object type in the object type tab names poison and set it to
  you type of poison.  This should fix the problem of different
  servers using different graphics for poisons.
- added support for OSI clients 3.0.5d. Injection not works will 
  All clients.  Note: Display is now broken in 3.0.4 and 3.0.5.  I 
  will have to figure out why they are not displaying stats and 
  resource counts. But at least injection is working for the most 
  part.
- Runebooks changed on TAR.  The runebooks commands no longer work
  on TAR. Will fix later.
- may have fixed the object from target crash bug.  Let me know if 
  you still get a crash here.

===================================================================

  defined as a hotkey.
- fixed bug in dbl targeting system
- add poison command to use poison skill on an object
  syntax: poison (object)
  poison potion (type 0xf0a) must be inpack
- added command fixhotkeys
  occasionally the hotkey driver get uninstalled.  Until I find the
  cause, this command will reinitilize the hotkey driver.  If your
  hotkeys stop responding, use this command. 
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.24

- fixed spelling error in display tab
- added Hotkeys
  There is a new hotkey tab.  Click the Hotkey text box and press 
  the hot key you want to program.  Enter the command in the 
  command text box.  Commands are entered WITHOUT the comma (,) in
  front.  Click new.

===================================================================
v 0.3.23

- made spell code more robust
- fixed bug where last target would get set to 0 under lag.
- added useskill command.  
  Syntax: ,useskill 'skill name' [target] 
  'skill name" needs to be the full skill name and is case 
  sensitive.  Optionally you can pass and last, self, Object name 
  or serial target.
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.22

- added runebook command setdefault
  syntax: setdefault (runebook) (rune number)
- added runebook command recall
  syntax: recall (runebook) (rune number)
- added runebook command gate
  syntax: gate (runebook) (rune number)
- fixed bug in waittargettype

===================================================================
v 0.3.21

- modified the setcatchbag command to optionally take an object 
  argument.  Example:
  ,setcatchbag 0x400c00be
  or
  ,setcatchbag bluebag
  where bluebag is a registered Object
  if you do not pass an object to the command, it will give a 
  targeting cursor.
- modified the setreceivingcontainer command to optionally take an
  object argument.  See above for details.
- added addrecall and addgate commands to add charger to runebooks.
  syntax: addrecall (runebook) 
          addgate (runebook)
          where runebook is the serial of the book of a name
          registered in the Objects Tab.  The correct scrolls need
          to be in your pack.
  These may or may not work your shard. It depends on the runebook
  scripts used.  It does work on TheAlterRealm where I play and 
  that is mostly what counts  :)
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.20

- streamlined menu system.  
  new syntax: waitmenu 'prompt' 'choice' ['prompt2' 'choice2']
  removed command choosemenu
  Example to make a Greater Heal potion (single menu):
  ,waitmenu 'potion' 'Greater Heal'
  dbl click mortar
  dbl click ginseng
  Example to make Beastform Boar potion (double menu):
  ,waitmenu 'potion' 'BeastForm' 'Beastform' 'Beastform Boar'
  dbl click mortar
  dbl click ginseng

- streamlined targeting system.
  new syntax:
  waittargetself
  waittargetlast
  waittargettype (object type) [color]
  waittargetobject (object) [object]
  waittargetobjecttype (object) (object type) [color]
  removed all choosetarget commands:
  Example targeting self:
  ,waittargetself
  ,use bandage      Not a good example cauue the ,bandageself
                    but illistrates the use.
  Example targeting an object type like filling a keg:
  ,waittargettype poison
  dbl click keg
  Example poisoning a weapon:
  ,waittargetobjecttype sword poison
  use poison skill
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.19

- fixed bug #466618 & #464769
- added server config attributes buy and sell.  These can be used 
  to change the text sent to the server when using the buy and sell
  commands.  This is useful on servers that have changed the vendor
  commands to another language other than english. 
- modified choosemenu command to take an optional 
  'next menu prompt' parameter.  Now submenues can be handled.
  Example:
  ,waitmenu 'potion'
  commands to make a beast form
  ,choosemenu 'Beastform' 'potion'
  ,choosemenu 'Rabbit'
- modified targetobject command to take optional waittarget 
  parameter.  Now subtargeting can be handled.
  Example:
  ,waittarget
  use poison skill
  ,targetobject sword waittarget
  ,targettype poison

  words last and self.  Now recall can be cast on a rune with 
  single command.

  Pane  
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.18

- fixed bug in catchbag where an item that could not be placed in 
  the bag would bounce around in the pack. 
- added bandageself command

===================================================================
v 0.3.17

- add catchbag
  commands setcatchbag and unsetcatchbag will setup and clear a 
  container that all items that are added to your backpack are 
  placed in.  When you user the setcatchbag and target a container,
  all crafted items or purchased items are placed in the bag. 
  unsetcatchbag clears it and items endup in your pack as usual.
  Note: When crafting, supplies should be placed in another bag.
  Because the way items are consumed, if in backpack, they will
  be moved to the catchbag.  Experiment and you will see what I 
  mean.
- modified disarm
  if there is a Object defined in the Object Panel with the name
  "disarmbag", when disarming, weapons will be placed in the 
  defined bag. If no bag defined, they goto backpack as usual.
- modified undress
  if there is a Object defined in the Object Panel with the name
  "undressbag", when undressing, cloths will be placed in the 
  defined bag. If no bag defined, they goto backpack as usual.
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.16

- changes the commands use and target to usetype and targettype
  this is to make it more clear their use.  no functional change
- fixed arm set bug #465227
- added commands removehat, removeearrings, removeneckless, 
  removering
- documentation is no longer included in the distribution. Please
  see on-line documentation @ http://injection.sourceforge.net
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.15

- fixed typo in paralyze spell name
- now cancel auto targeting when no spell in book or beyond ability
- added multiple arm sets.  Works exactly as the dress sets work
  added the command unsetarm to make it complete.

- Updated the included the latest Ingnition.cfg

===================================================================
v 0.3.14

- added targeting to teh cast command
  new syntax is: cast 'spell name' target
  where target is ether last or self
  example: ,cast 'Magic Arrow' last
  will cast Magic Arrow at last target

===================================================================
v 0.3.13

- added targetlast and taregtself to the targeting system
  use inplace to the target or targetobject command

===================================================================
v 0.3.12

- fixed bug when deleteing object, nothing happened.
- addes cast command.  Syntax: ,cast 'spell name'
  'spell name" needs to be the full name from the spellbook and is
  case sensitive
  
===================================================================
v 0.3.11

- added this log to track changes between documentation updates.
- changed the use tab name to Object Type to better reflect the use
  of the tab.  No functional change.
- added Object Tab, used to register specific objects like the type
  tab
- added the useobject and targetobject commands.  Works like the 
  use and target commands but uses specific items regestered in the
  Object Tab.
- changed the name of "2.0.0" encryption to 
  "2.0.0 (OSI Client > 2.0.0" to better describe the encryption. 
  No functional change.
- changed the name of "1.26.4" encryption to 
  "1.26.4 (OSI Client < 2.0.0" to better describe the encryption. 
  No functional change.
- added speed control to the emptyconainer command
  new syntax is 'emptycontainer num' where num is the miliseconds
  to pause between moves.  Note: the client does not update until
  the emptycontainer command is complete.  However, the items are
  being moved, you just dont see the results until the client 
  updates its view.  I recomend a speed of 500-1000 on shards that 
  frown on this feature.  This will make it look realistic enough
  to do away with any concerns they may have.
