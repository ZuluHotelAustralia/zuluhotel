Compiling Injection
-------------------

I use the Mingw32 development tools to compile Injection, which can be
downloaded from: http://www.mingw.org/

Compiling on Windows 9x using Mingw-1.0-20010608 also requires the W95Patch
from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/. Also, the latest
binutils-2.11.90-20010705 package from the Mingw site is needed to properly
link the DLL.

The resource editor from the lcc-win32 programming environment was used to
create the resource script, and a bug in the current version of windres means
that the lcc resource compiler is used to compile the resources. lcc-win32 is
available from: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/

The only third-party library that I used is 'expat', which is a lightweight
XML parsing library. See http://expat.sourceforge.net/ for more information.
If you are using Mingw to compile Injection, go to the Mingw Packages
Repository for a development binary of expat:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwrep/

---------------------------
Using Visual C++ to compile
---------------------------

Injection was ported to VC 6.0. The older/newer versions were not tested.
To compile Injection you'll need to get the latest version of STL. Download 
it from http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stl.zip. And download VC version of expat 
from http://expat.sourceforge.net/.
Don't forget to add Injection, STL and Expat directories to Options->
Directories->Include files in VC IDE. STL directory should be topmost in the 
list (even before standart include dirs).
Don't use VC resource editor on injection.rc or you'll get errors when
you'll build it with MinGW.
