** DONE So yeah, this occurs with a wooden shield with m_Resource set to any wooden resource other than RegularWood.  If you set it to an ore or to RegularWood this does not crash.
   get_PhysicalResistance calls GetProtOffset(), GetResourceAttrs().ArmorPhysicalResist
   GetResourceAttrs calls into CraftResources.GetInfo, looks like this is it

** DONE dont allow mark/recall/gate in moonglow/council of mages

** DONE allow casing in council of mages
   UNABLE TO DUPLICATE

** DONE clean up zone after endgame

** TODO daleron don't let zone markers get worldsaved

** DONE can't [escape properly

** DONE Crafting skill gains
   Verify the boost in smithy shop

** TODO Can only sell iron ore to vendor
   Do we care?  You can sell colours items, but they sell for the same
   price as iron

** DONE Mining action timer

** TODO coloured ore AR rating
   Verify this scales how we want it

** TODO Material Special Property (ex silver vs undead).
   Should silver weapons do bonus against undead?  I think we're
   missing special properties of all ores.

** DONE Crafting region near newbie dungeon
