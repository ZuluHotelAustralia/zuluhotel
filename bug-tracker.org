* DONE So yeah, this occurs with a wooden shield with m_Resource set to any wooden resource other than RegularWood.  If you set it to an ore or to RegularWood this does not crash.
   get_PhysicalResistance calls GetProtOffset(), GetResourceAttrs().ArmorPhysicalResist
   GetResourceAttrs calls into CraftResources.GetInfo, looks like this is it
* DONE dont allow mark/recall/gate in moonglow/council of mages
* DONE allow casing in council of mages
   UNABLE TO DUPLICATE
* DONE clean up zone after endgame
* TODO daleron don't let zone markers get worldsaved
* DONE can't [escape properly
* DONE Crafting skill gains
   Verify the boost in smithy shop
* DONE Can only sell iron ore to vendor
   Do we care?  You can sell colours items, but they sell for the same
   price as iron
   I don't care about price deltas but they should accept coloured ore
* DONE Mining action timer
* DONE coloured ore AR rating
   Verify this scales how we want it
* TODO Material Special Property (ex silver vs undead).
   Should silver weapons do bonus against undead?  I think we're
   missing special properties of all ores.
* DONE Crafting region near newbie dungeon
* DONE battle royale should report when it will start next
* DONE assess weight of smith hammer
* TODO should bards have pvp damage ability
* TODO increase range on spears/polearms
* TODO increase restock of vendors
* DONE console spam from crafting
* TODO make a command list, unless perhaps [help works 
* DONE add spam to see where you should go in BR
* TODO add a sellall command
* TODO battle royale timers and chat spam need sanity checks
* DONE make skillgain high in moonglow
* DONE make items spawn identified in battleroyale
* TODO lumberjacking
  sith sez:  what's the actual bug here?  is it referring to this commit: c47e03384386ecd65c0b2ebf0f7916a741836517 ?
* DONE arms lore only goes to 100
* TODO upstream has some code that needs tracking manually, some of it can be ignored
* TODO up the quantity of reagents/potions on the mage vendor.
* TODO Range of spear/polearms
* TODO monsters return to spawn
  sith sez: does this mean they don't and should?  Current behaviour is per OSI spec
* DONE Monsters take your shit?
  sith sez:  see [[file:Server/Scripts/Mobiles/BaseCreature.cs::5103][EnableRummaging setting in BaseCreature] 
* TODO boats are buggy as fuck (and also are in -> take em out)
* DONE crafting is too slow for beta
* DONE update MOTD to reflect new clilocs for crafting
* TODO coloured logs are just called "log"
* TODO gathernodes are escaping the boundaries of the map
