* TODO Items to tackle immediately after a "1.0" launch [0/9]
  :properties:
  :cookie_data: todo_recursive
  :end:
** TODO "instahit"
** TODO make an object that drops only in chicane that summons a red moongate on the pentagram that leads to the boss room.  make that item only drop once every 8 hours on the miniboss.  Do same for Doom.  Golden dragon spawns there with backup.
** TODO ensure only spec crafters can work with and mine the jewels
** TODO looted slayers can have their essences extracted by e.g. scribes who then take the essence to a crafter who can put it into a weapon
** TODO change it so that you can choose to search for a particular ore, and not just strike a list randomly.
** TODO balron (make them stronger or else make an elder balron)
** TODO baseweapon should scale durability based on craftresource
** TODO bosses for dungeons that aren't necessarily champions
** TODO set e.g. gauntlet or something as easy to gather but hard to work with and produce good results for bows or whatever
** TODO write a command to save out all the fucking spawners
