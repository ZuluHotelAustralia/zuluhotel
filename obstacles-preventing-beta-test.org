This is a list of all the things that need to be done before we can launch a beta server, broken down as much as possible

* TODO finish off GatherSystem
** TODO new class GatherTarget, similar to HarvestTarget
*** special checks for GatherTarget.OnTarget:
**** TODO use mining on a grave to get bones, see HarvestTarget.cs for tile ids
**** DONE check if using lumberjacking on an IChopable, call targeted.OnChop
**** DONE check if using an axe (lumberjacking) on an IAxe, then call targeted.Axe 
**** DONE check if using lumberjacking on an ICarvable, call targeted.carve
**** DONE check if furnitureattribute.check(targeted as item), then DestroyFurniture()
**** DONE check if using mining on a treasuremap, call (tmap)targeted.onBeginDig
**** otherwise it just calls StartHarvesting if none of those are true
** TODO derive new GatherSystem skill-specific classes from GatherSystem
*** TODO make gathersystem abstract
*** TODO edit gathersystemcontroller to reflect the above -> spawn multiple
*** use FOAM or whatever to generate as much as possible -> tile lists etc.
** TODO finish writing code to scale harvest rates based on proximity to node
* TODO finish off Necro and Earth magic
** TODO summoning and "taming" spells
** TODO check sounds/vfx
** TODO edit cliloc/gump to change spell names (necro/spellweaving for earth)
* TODO implement skillgain rate scaling based on player's region
** DONE define a new overlay region class (or perhaps edit baseregion) with configurable gain rates
*** DONE make gains slow as fuck in houses
*** DONE make gains very fast in dungeons
*** TODO make ranger skills like taming/tracking gain very fast in wilderness areas (unless we want to radically change taming?)
*** DONE ensure crafting gains are slow everywhere (but not as slow as in houses)
*** TODO make little "crafting zones" in towns where crafting skills are slightly accelerated
* TODO make sure Spec actually works
** TODO damage taken
*** TODO magic damage taken by warriors
*** TODO physical damage taken by warriors
*** TODO physical damage taken by mages
** TODO damage dealt
*** TODO ranged damage dealt by rangers
*** TODO magic damage dealt by mages
*** TODO physical damage dealt by mages
*** TODO magic damage dealt by warriors
*** TODO physical damage dealt by warriors
** DONE skillgain for class skills
