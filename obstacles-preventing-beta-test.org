This is a list of all the things that need to be done before we can launch a beta server, broken down as much as possible

Bugs go here:  [[file:bug-tracker.org][le tracker de bugs]]

* DONE finish off GatherSystem: [[oretable]] [[logtable]] [[hidetable]] [95/95]
:PROPERTIES:
:COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
:END:
** DONE distance calculations and/or maxskill ceilings need a sanity check
** DONE new class GatherTarget, similar to HarvestTarget
*** special checks for GatherTarget.OnTarget:
**** DONE use mining on a grave to get bones, see HarvestTarget.cs for tile ids
     NOTE: not going to implement the above any time soon.  We can spawn gravedust or whatever in loot on undeads
**** DONE check if using lumberjacking on an IChopable, call targeted.OnChop
**** DONE check if using an axe (lumberjacking) on an IAxe, then call targeted.Axe
**** DONE check if using lumberjacking on an ICarvable, call targeted.carve
**** DONE check if furnitureattribute.check(targeted as item), then DestroyFurniture()
**** DONE check if using mining on a treasuremap, call (tmap)targeted.onBeginDig
**** DONE otherwise it just calls StartHarvesting if none of those are true
** DONE derive new GatherSystem skill-specific classes from GatherSystem
*** DONE flesh them out
**** DONE make gathersystem abstract
** DONE initial setup command
** DONE verify lumberjacking is complete

*** DONE also there's an issue with l33t code missing in onconcurrentgather()
*** DONE also it asks you where you want to mine
** DONE verify fishing is complete
*** DONE it's not:  there's no sound or animation
** DONE verify mining is complete
*** DONE There's no gathernode for Sand, and mining might let you mine ore on sand tiles.. fix this
**** DONE sand doesn't stack
**** DONE mining sand gives wrong cliloc messages
*** DONE There's probably no CraftResource for Sand
** DONE ores and logs don't stack with others of the same type
** DONE add the other nodes to each resource
** DONE verify/fix cliloc strings in gathering engine
** DONE turns out we gotta generate the logs:  make and awk here we go fuckers
** DONE actually give them resources
** DONE deal with [[file:filestoupdate.txt]]

** DONE resource properties (quality multiplier for AR or damage)
** DONE resource hues, names, and properties propagate to crafted items
** DONE add logs and granite names to clilocs
** DONE remove this.Name hack from ingots

**** DONE range
**** DONE alive
**** DONE tool not broken
**** DONE tile
**** DONE skill

* DONE finish off Necro and Earth magic [9/9]
:PROPERTIES:
:COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
:END:
** DONE summoning and "taming" spells
** DONE check sounds/vfx: [[spellstable]]
** DONE implement Elemental Lords so that you can do Earth Magic properly

*** OK So the actual spellbook names are in the client, whereas the hover-text is from the cliloc
*** DONE Earth Clilocs
*** DONE Earth spells in client
*** DONE Necro clilocs
*** DONE necro spells in client
** DONE fix spell scroll item names (itemID parameter)
* DONE implement skillgain rate scaling based on player's region [7/7]
:PROPERTIES:
:COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
:END:
** DONE define a new overlay region class (or perhaps edit baseregion) with configurable gain rates
*** DONE make gains slow as fuck in houses
*** DONE make gains very fast in dungeons
*** DONE make ranger skills like taming/tracking gain very fast in wilderness areas (unless we want to radically change taming?)
*** DONE ensure crafting gains are slow everywhere (but not as slow as in houses)
*** DONE flesh out derived regions with appropriate gain rates
*** DONE check server/skills.cs for proper operation of Skill.Value because there are references to "100.0" in there
* DONE make sure Spec actually works [12/12]
:PROPERTIES:
:COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
:END:
** DONE damage taken
*** DONE magic damage taken by warriors

:end:
** DONE disable or silently convert characters to defaults if they try to generate a character with ninjitsu or something, same with elves
** DONE Criminal to loot spider?
   Maybe criminal to loot somebody elses kill
   Yes, was an anti-griefing tactic implemented in ~2007 to prevent blue players with Stealth skills from stealing loot from monsters without consequence.  Imagine being a newbie and some thief just stands there invisible, taking the gold from every kill, and you can't attack him without flagging because he's blue.
** DONE Cliloc errors on all armor
   Leahter, bone, etc.
   Weird shit really.
** DONE add vendor who sells bandages
** DONE Chests by first skeletal mage spawns circle 1-6 scrolls in fire dungeon ( [add leetspawner )
** DONE cut robes for bandages
** DONE Decide if we want to remove Bolas
*** on second thought the ability to dismount your opponent might make for interesting pvp dynamics and reduce offscreening
** DONE Add alchemist who sells useful potions for warriors?
*** Mage vendors sell all the base potions
** DONE Bump up quantity of items in vendors
*** DONE regs
*** DONE bandies
** DONE Add a vendor who sells pagan regs
** DONE Disable concussion blow and other bullshit special moves
** DONE make sure necro scrolls drop in loot

** DONE and the books for earth and necro
** TODO playtest gathering to ensure it's actually within the realm of viable
** DONE check Beta Invite System start locations, etc.  Make a "lobby" start loc
** DONE playtest Battle Royalebat
** DONE looks like there's a bug in the lumberjacking gump to do with categorizing your log types
** DONE implement [spec
** DONE playtest taking e.g. a warrior from newbie to spec 1 without macroing
*** honestly I'm pretty confident you can bootstrap a warrior and thus any other class
** DONE perform minimal spawning of Serpent's Hold and perhaps the Fire Dungeon
** DONE make magic reflect work like t2a (reflects one hostile spell instead of several circles' worth)
** DONE make reactive armor work like t2a too
** DONE does dispel not kill buffs/debuffs?
** DONE a whole 2nd set of implicit skillcaps re: code passing minSkill and maxSkill to the handler functions
*** DONE ensure timelines/gain rates for stats and skills are legit
**** DONE make baseregion decent gain, like a=0.03, then slow it down in houses to 0.0005
**** DONE for above, maybe don't make combat quite as fast but definitely speed up e.g. taming and healing and stuff
**** DONE macefighting, parrying, and possibly a few others don't gain properly
***** it was just the [trainskill command not being a fully-complete test harness so to speak
*** DONE stats too
** DONE figure out why teleporters (i.e. cave doors, stairs, moongates) don't work

* TODO Items to tackle after launching beta but before "1.0" [17/35]
:properties:
:cookie_data: todo recursive
:end:
** DONE Fix gathersystem timing so it awards resources after the animation plays
** TODO make sure warriors deal more stamina damage with spec
** TODO make sure elemental shit works
** TODO make sure you can dispel any Earth/Necro transformations
** TODO "instahit"
** TODO auction house that takes a 10% cut (ish)
** DONE gathersystem asks "where do you wish to place this?" when lumberjacking
** TODO make it so skills/stats go to 130 but with mods you can get to 150
** TODO make sure pagans are spawning in loot
** DONE honestly gathersystem probably still has some fucked up cliloc calls... fix these/crowdsource them
** DONE make an ongoing minigame environment to encourage pvp during beta/debugging phase
*** DONE make it tarkov or pubg or something
** TODO ensure only spec crafters can work with and mine the jewels
** TODO fix baseweapon damage levels based on craftresource
** TODO fix baseweapon/basearmor exceptional quality stuff (Core.AOS)
** TODO set e.g. gauntlet or something as easy to gather but hard to work with and produce good results for bows or whatever
** TODO hides
** DONE make little "crafting zones" in towns where crafting skills are slightly accelerated
** TODO "Survey tool" lets you dig for samples to see what's there, using tasteID and a spoon.  Your guy just tastes the dirt.
** TODO check SpellHelper.CheckTravel for beta remnants
** DONE antimacro code [8/8]
:PROPERTIES:
:COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
:END:
*** DONE send gump right before they get the cursor in gathertarget
*** DONE gump can't be dismissable by right click
*** DONE gump needs to give them 2 minutes or so
*** DONE decide on consequences
*** DONE pick the one that doesn't match, perhaps simple arithmetic
*** DONE create a meta object to hold all the timers and references and shit to avoid duplication of timers when gump is re-sent.
*** DONE decide if you want to kick them or not upon jail, because there seems to be no way to dismiss the gump
*** DONE see if we can just send an exit command to the gump by spoofing a reply or something.
** TODO fix Server/Skills.cs because there are several references to 100.0 in there and we go to 130.0
** TODO anti corruption code [2/3]
:properties:
:cookie_data: todo recursive
:end:
*** DONE log items created by staff
*** DONE log edits done to characters by staff
*** TODO publish logs automagically
** TODO figure out how jail works in runuo - there seems to be no [jail command
