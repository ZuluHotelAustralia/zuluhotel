# RunZH

RunZH is an emulator for the popular Zulu Hotel series of Ultima Online shards.  RunZH is based on RunUO (github.com/runuo/runuo), many thanks to Mark.  RunZH targets Microsoft's new .NET Core platform, and Mono- or Windows-specific builds are deprecated.  Assuming your dotnet core runtime is set up properly, building RunZH should be as simple as:

```
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet run
```
