* A list of Achievements
Basically take each playermobile and add an achievements hashtable or whatever, which stores the name of the achievement, a description, and a bool for whether or not you've achieved it.  The [achievements command will show you a gump with what you've achieved but not what you haven't achieved.  The description of achievements you've earned will perhaps say "deal x damage to players" but

Some ideas:
- Adventurer - Find Sophie and Grenouille
- God of War - Deal 65536 damage to players
- Slayer - Deal 65536 damage to monsters
- Lord of Pain - Receive 65536 damage
- Light fingers - Steal X number of items
- Maestro - Play music for x number of mins
- Columbus - visit lots of the world
- Balance - visit all the shrines
- Scoundrel - Become red
- Redemption - Become blue after becoming red
- Baller - have 100k gold in your bank
- Make it rain - have 1 million gold in your bank
- Dunked on - Get killed by the same player twice in a row
- Outcast - Cast Wraith Form enough times that your skin stays white and you're "marked for life" or something
- Atonement - Somehow get your hue away from Outcast hue?
